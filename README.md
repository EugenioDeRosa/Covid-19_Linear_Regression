# COVID-19 Data Analysis with Linear Regression

This project analyzes COVID-19 data in Italy using linear regression. It includes the following files:

1. dataset_weekly_covid_19_italy.csv - A CSV file containing weekly COVID-19 data for Italy.

2. lr.py - A Python script to perform linear regression on the dataset.

# Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+

Required Python libraries (install via pip):

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

# Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure the dataset_weekly_covid_19_italy.csv file is in the same directory as lr.py.

# How to Run

Install the required libraries if you havenâ€™t already:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Execute the Python script:

python lr.py

The script will read the data from the CSV file, perform linear regression, and output results. It may also display a plot of the regression results if applicable.

# Output

The script processes the dataset and provides insights based on the regression model. Output details include:

1. A summary of the regression results

2. Visualizations of the data and regression line
